# Employees CRUD

A web application based on [React JS](https://reactjs.org) interfaces, RESTful API [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) using [Express 4](http://expressjs.com/) and [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org).

## Running Locally

Make sure you have [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) and npm installed.
```
npm install
npm start
```

The front-end app runs off localhost:3000. The REST API is located in the /server folder and runs off localhost:8080.

## Running Tests

End-to-end tests implemented to all API endpoints.

```
npm test
```

## API Doc
Only one simple example of how to make a request in the API.

### Create Employee
URL: /api/employees

Method: POST

**Example Call:**
```
curl -H "Content-type:application/json" \
     http://localhost:8080/api/employees \
     -d '{"name": "Steve","code": "F00","profession": "Dev","color": "#ff0000","city": "Toronto","branch": "Brampton", "assigned": "1"}'
```

**Example Result**
```
{
  "employee":  
    {
      "id": 1,
      "name":"Steve",
      "code":"F00",
      "profession":"Dev",
      "color":"#ff0000",
      "city":"Toronto",
      "branch":"Brampton",
      "assigned":1
    }
}
```

# Important Notes

The chosen architecture was defined considering the most commonly used technologies in the Node.js and React, following the best practices of code styling, tests and RESTful API patterns. A bunch of other things and improvements could be implemented like testing coverage, authentication, security modules, etc.
